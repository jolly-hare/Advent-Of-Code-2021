# Why
Starting with a blank state because I need the practice. I'll try to post my daily solutions if I find the correct answer(s). In later days, I may spend some time cleaning up past solutions to more optimized or elegant alternate solutions.

# todo
build new_day script that creates a new local directory and root script file, pull down input data from: https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/X/input (where X = day #)
