# Advent-Of-Code-2021
My code for AoC2021 puzzles.

# Goal
Hoping to get at least 14 gold & 4 silver stars (2 gold star for solving both parts, 1 silver star for only solving first part)
Currently: 2 gold, 0 silver

# Why
Starting with a blank state because I need the practice. 

# todo
build new_day script that creates a new local directory and root script file, pull down input data from: https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/X/input (where X = day #)
